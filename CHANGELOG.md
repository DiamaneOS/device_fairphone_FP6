# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Build protected VM firmware from source and describe it in the system AVB
  chain, which the FP6 bootloader requires before loading a slot.
- Select the generic first-stage ramdisk, zero GKI header version fields and
  preserve the FP6 boot/recovery AVB chains and separate patch metadata.
- Integrate the FP6 product, source HALs, standard USB setup and development
  boot/recovery layout.
- Maintain selected Qualcomm policy as device source with exact upstream
  provenance and enforcing native checks.
- Install the selected graphics, trusted-execution and Type-C ownership rules.
  Device boot and runtime behavior remain to be verified.
